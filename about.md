I'm a software engineer at Mobile Vikings. I mainly use Python and Django but I have a past in ASP.NET and C#. JavaScript doesn't scare me either.

I don't like things that are unnecessarily complex. Things should be as simple as they can be. That's why I like to approach code, collaborative workflows and software architecture in general with a mindset of optimization by simplification.

It is my strong belief that DRY is overused and often followed too blindly. Code that is _too_ DRY is often hard to work with. Hence the name of this blog. I'll have MOIST code over DRY code any day. I'm still looking for a relevant catch phrase that has MOIST as an acronym. I am so convinced of this that I chose MOIST as the name for this blog. At work my subteam is called the _Ministry of Code_. I have given myself the title of _Minister of Indentation, Spaces and Tabs_, which has MOIST as its acronym. What a happy coincidence.
